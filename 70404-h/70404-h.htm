<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c016'>IN THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>For sixteen hundred years prior to the war between Great Britain
and the Colonies, the pages of history bear no record of the Negro
as a soldier. Tracing his separate history in the Revolutionary
War, is a task of much difficulty, for the reason that while individual
instances of valor and patriotism abound there were so few separate
bodies of Negro troops, that no separate record appears to have been
made. The simple fact is that the fathers as a rule enlisted men
both for the Army and Navy, just as now, is only continued by the
Navy, that is to say, they were assigned wherever needed, without
regard to race or color. Varner’s Rhode Island Battalion appears
to have been the only large aggregation of Negroes in this war,
though Connecticut, New York, and New Hampshire each furnished
one separate company in addition to individuals scattered through
their other organizations, so that ere the close of the war, there
were very few brigades, regiments, or companies in which the Negro
was not in evidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>The free Negro appears to have gone in from the beginning without
attracting or calling out special comment. Later, as men grew
scarcer and necessity more pressing, slaves were taken in also, and
then the trouble began. Those who held slaves did not care to lose
them in this way. Others who had not, did not think it just the thing
in a war for avowed freedom to place an actual slave in the ranks to
fight. Some did not want the Negro, bond or free, to take part as
a soldier in the struggle. So that in May, 1775, the Massachusetts
Committee of Safety voted that thereafter only free men should be
enlisted. In July, Gen. Gates issued an order prohibiting further
enlistments of Negroes, but saying nothing of those already in the
service.</p>

<p class='c012'>In October, a council of war, presided over by Gen. Washington,
comprising three Major Generals and six Brigadier Generals, voted
unanimously against the enlistment of slaves, and by a decided majority
against further enlistments of Negroes. Ten days later in a conference
held at Cambridge, Mass., participated in by Gen. Washington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Benj. Franklin, Benj. Harrison, Thos. Lynch, and the deputy
governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, the same action was
taken.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the 7th November, 1775, Earl Dundore, commanding the forces
of His Majesty the King, issued a proclamation offering freedom and
equal pay to all slaves who would join his armies as soldiers. It did
not take the colonists long to find out their mistake, although Gen.
Washington, in accordance with the expressed will of his officers and
of the Committee of Safety, did on the 17th Nov., 1775, issue a proclamation
forbidding the further enlistment of Negroes. Less than two
months later, that is to say on the 30th Dec., 1775, he issued a second
proclamation again authorizing the enlistment of free Negroes. He
advised Congress of his action, and stated that he would recall it if
so directed. But he was not. The splendid service rendered by
the Negro and the great and pressing need of men were such, that
although the opposition continued from some sections, it was not
thereafter strong enough to get recognition. So the Negroes went
and came much as did other men.</p>

<p class='c012'>In all the events of the war, from Bunker Hill to Yorktown,
they bore an honorable part. The history of the doings of the
armies is their history, as in everything they took part and did
their share. Their total enlistment was about 3,000 men. A very
fair percentage for the then population. I might instance the
killing of Major Pitcairn, at Bunker Hill, by Peter Salem, and of
Major Montgomery at Fort Griswold by Jordan Freeman. The part
they took in the capture of Major-General Prescott at Newport;
their gallant defense of Colonel Greene, their beloved commander,
when he was surprised and murdered at Croton River, May 13, 1781,
when it was only after the last of his faithful guards had been shot
and cut down that he was reached; or at the battle of Rhode Island,
when a battalion of 400 Negroes withstood three separate and distinct
charges from 1,500 Hessians under Count Donop, and beat them back
with such tremendous loss that Count Donop at once applied for an
exchange, fearing that his men would kill him if he went into battle
with them again, for having exposed them to such slaughter; and
many other instances that are of record. The letter following, written
Dec. 5, 1775, explains itself;</p>

<p class='c018'><i>To the Honorable General Court of the Massachusetts Bay.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>The subscribers beg leave to report to your Honorable House
(which we do in justice to the character of so brave a man), that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>under our own observation we declare that a Negro Man named
Salem Poor, of Col. Frye’s Regiment, Cap. Ames’ Company, in the
late battle at Charleston, behaved like an experienced officer as
well as an excellent soldier. To set forth particulars of his conduct
would be tedious. We would only beg to say, in the person of this
Negro centers a brave and gallant soldier. The reward due to so
great and distinguished a character, we submit to Congress.</p>

<p class='c021'>This is a splendid and well attested tribute to a gallant and worthy
Negro. There were many such, but, beyond receiving and reading
no action was taken thereon by Congress. There is no lack of
incidents and the temptation to quote many of them is great, but the
time allotted me is too brief for extended mention and I must bring
this branch of my subject to a close. It is in evidence that while
so many Negroes were offering their lives a willing sacrifice for the
country, in some sections the officers of the Continental Forces received
their bounty and pay in Negroes, “grown” and “small,” instead
of “dollars” and “cents.” Fighting for <i>Liberty</i> and taking
pay in <i>Slaves</i>!</p>

<p class='c012'>When the war was over the free men returned to meet their same
difficulties; the slaves were caught when possible and reenslaved by
their former masters. In Boston a few years later we find a party of
black patriots of the Revolution mobbed on Boston Common while
celebrating the anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade.</p>

<p class='c012'>The captain of a vessel trading along the coast tells of a Negro
who had fought in the war and been distinguished for bravery and
soldierly conduct. He was reclaimed and reenslaved by his master
after the war, and served him faithfully until old age rendered him
useless. The master then brought the poor old slave to this captain
and asked him to take him along on his trip and try to sell him.
The captain hated to sell a man who had fought for his country,
but finally agreed, took the poor old man to Mobile, and sold him
for $100 to a man who put him to attending a chicken coop. His
former master continued to draw the old slave’s pension as a soldier,
in the Revolution, until he died.</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>THE WAR OF 1812.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The war of 1812 was mainly fought upon the water, and in the
American navy at that time the Negro stood in the ratio of about
one to six. We find record of complaint by Commodore Perry at
the beginning because of the large number of Negroes sent him,
but later the highest tribute to their bravery and efficiency. Capt.
Shaler, of the armed brig General Thompson, writing of an engagement
between his vessel and a British frigate, says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The name of one of my poor fellows, who was killed, ought to
be registered in the book of fame, and remembered as long as
bravery is a virtue. He was a black man, by name John Johnson.
A twenty-four pound shot struck him in the hip, and took away all
the lower part of his body. In this state the poor brave fellow lay
on the deck, and several times exclaimed to his shipmates: ‘Fire
away, my boys; no haul a color down!’ Another black man, by
the name of John Davis, who was struck in much the same manner,
repeatedly requested to be thrown overboard, saying that he was
only in the way of others.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I know of nothing finer in history than these.</p>

<p class='c012'>As before, the Negro was not universally welcomed to the ranks
of the American army; but later continued reverses and a lack of
enthusiasm in enlistments made it necessary to seek his aid, and
from Mobile, Ala., on September 21, 1814, General Jackson issued
a stirring call to the free colored people of Louisiana for aid. It
began thus:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Through a mistaken policy you have heretofore been deprived
of a participation in the glorious struggle for national rights in which
our country is engaged. This no longer shall exist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In a remarkably short period, two battalions were raised, under
Majors LaCaste and Savary, which did splendid service in the
battle of New Orleans. New York enrolled two battalions, and
sent them to Sacketts Harbor. Pennsylvania enrolled twenty-four
hundred, and sent them to Gray’s Ferry at the capture of Washington,
to prepare for the invading column. Another battalion also
was raised, armed, equipped and ready to start to the front, when
peace was declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us hear the testimony of that original democrat, General
Jackson. Under the date of Dec. 18, 1814, he writes as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the men of color, soldiers: From the shores of Mobile I
called you to arms. I invited you to share in the perils and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>divide the glory of your white countrymen. I expected much
from you; for I was not uninformed of those qualities which must
render you so formidable to an invading foe. I knew you could
endure hunger and thirst, and all the hardships of war. I knew that
you loved the land of your nativity, and that, like ourselves, you
had to defend all that is most dear to man. But you surpass my
hopes. I have found in you, united to those qualities, that noble
enthusiasm that impels to great deeds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Soldiers: The President of the United States shall be informed
of your conduct on the present occasion, and the voice of the representatives
of the American nation shall applaud your valor, as your
general now praises your ardor. The enemy is near. His sails
cover the lakes, but the brave are united, and if he finds us contending
among ourselves, it will be for the prize of valor, and fame
its noblest reward.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In one of the actions of this war, a charging column of the American
army was repulsed and thrown into great disorder. A Negro
private, seeing the disaster, sprang upon a horse, and by heroic
effort rallied the troops, led them back upon a second charge, and
completely routed the enemy. He was rewarded by General Jackson
with the honorary title of Major. Under the laws he could not
commission him.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the war was over, this gallant man returned to his home
in Nashville, Tenn., where he lived for years afterward, highly
respected by its citizens of all races.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the age of seventy years, this black hero was obliged, <i>in self-defense</i>,
to strike a white ruffian, who had assaulted him. Under
the laws of the State he was arrested and given nine and thirty
lashes on his bare back. It broke his heart, and Major Jeffreys
died.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE WAR FOR THE UNION.</h3>

<p class='c021'>It seems a little singular that in the tremendous struggle between
the States in 1861-1865, the south should have been the first to take
steps toward the enlistment of Negroes. Yet such is the fact. Two
weeks after the fall of Fort Sumter, the “Charleston Mercury”
records the passing through Augusta of several companies of the
3rd and 4th Georgia Regt., and of sixteen well-drilled companies
<i>and one Negro company</i> from Nashville, Tenn.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Memphis Avalanche” and “The Memphis Appeal” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>May 9, 10, and 11, 1861, give notice of the appointment by the
“Committee of Safety” of a committee of three persons “to organize
a volunteer company composed of our patriotic freemen of color
of the city of Memphis, for the service of our common defense.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A telegram from New Orleans dated November 23, 1861, notes
the review by Gov. Moore of over 28,000 troops, and that one regiment
comprised “<i>1,400 colored men</i>.” “The New Orleans Picayune,”
referring to a review held February 9, 1862, says: “We
must also pay a deserved compliment to the companies of free
colored men, all very well drilled and comfortably equipped.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a little odd, too, that in the evacuation of New Orleans a
little later, in April, 1862, all of the troops succeeded in getting
away except the Negroes. They “got left.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not in the line of this paper to speculate upon what would
have been the result of the war had the South kept up this policy,
enlisted the freemen, and emancipated the enlisting slaves and
their families. The immense addition to their fighting force, the
quick recognition of them by Great Britain, to which slavery was
the greatest bar, and the fact that the heart of the Negro was with
the South but for slavery, and the case stands clear. But the
primary successes of the South closed its eyes to its only chance of
salvation, while at the same time the eyes of the North were opened.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1865, the South saw, and endeavored to remedy its error. On
March 9, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed a bill, recommended
by Gen. Lee, authorizing the enlistment of 200,000 Negroes; but it
was then too late.</p>

<p class='c012'>The North came slowly and reluctantly to recognize the Negro as
a factor for good in the war. “This is a white man’s war,” met the
Negroes at every step of their first efforts to gain admission to the
armies of the Union.</p>

<p class='c012'>To General David Hunter more than to any other one man, is due
the credit for the successful entry upon the stage of the Negro as a
soldier in this war.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the spring of 1862, he raised and equipped a regiment of
Negroes in South Carolina, and when the fact became known in
Washington and throughout the country, such a storm was raised
about the ears of the administration that they gracefully stood
aside and left the brave general to fight his enemies in the front and
rear as best he might. He was quite capable to do both, as it
proved.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>On the 9th of June, 1862, Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, introduced
a resolution in the House of Representatives, which was passed,
calling upon the Secretary of War for information as to the fact of
these enlistments and by what authority this matter was done.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Secretary of War replied under date June 14, 1862, disavowing
any official knowledge of such a regiment and denying that any
authority had been given therefor. He referred the resolution to
Gen. Hunter. His reply is one of the best things of the war. I
quote it entire.</p>

<p class='c022'>Headquarters, Department of the South,</p>
<p class='c023'>Port Royal, S. C., June 23, 1862.</p>
<p class='c024'>Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War,</p>
<p class='c025'>Washington.</p>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication
from the Adjutant-General of the Army, dated June 16, 1862,
requesting me to furnish you with the information necessary to
answer certain resolutions introduced in the House of Representatives
June 9, 1862, on motion of the Hon. Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky,
their substance being to inquire: First, whether I had
organized, or was organizing, a regiment of fugitive slaves in this
department; Second, whether any authority had been given to me
from the War Department for such organization; and Third,
whether I had been furnished by order of the War Department
with clothing, uniforms, arms, equipments, etc., for such a force.</p>

<p class='c019'>Only having received the letter conveying the inquiries at a late
hour on Saturday night, I urge forward my answer in time for the
steamer sailing to-day (Monday), this haste preventing me from
entering as minutely as I could wish upon many points of detail,
such as the paramount importance of the subject calls for. But in
view of the near termination of the present session of Congress,
and the widespread interest which must have been awakened by
Mr. Wickliffe’s resolution, I prefer sending even this imperfect
answer to waiting the period necessary for the collection of fuller
and more comprehensive data.</p>

<p class='c019'>To the first question, therefore, I reply that no regiment of “fugitive
slaves” has been or is organized in this department. There is,
however, a fine regiment of persons whose late masters are “fugitive
rebels,” men who everywhere fly before the appearance of the
national flag, leaving their servants behind them to shift as best
they can for themselves. So far, indeed, are the loyal persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>composing this regiment from seeking to avoid the presence of
their late owners that they are now, one and all, working with
remarkable industry to place themselves in a position to go in full
and effective pursuit of their fugacious and traitorous proprietors.</p>

<p class='c019'>To the second question, I have the honor to answer, that the
instructions given to Brig.-General W. T. Sherman by the Hon.
Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, and turned over to me by
succession for my guidance, do distinctly authorize me to employ all
loyal persons offering their services in defense of the Union and for
the suppression of this rebellion in any manner I might see fit, or
that the circumstances might call for. There is no restriction as to
the character or color of the persons who might be employed, or the
nature of the employment; whether civil or military, in which their
services should be used. I conclude, therefore, that I have been
authorized, to enlist “fugitive slaves” as soldiers, could any be found
in this department.</p>

<p class='c019'>No such characters have, however, yet appeared within our most
advanced pickets, the loyal slaves everywhere remaining on their
plantations to welcome us, and supply us with food, labor and information.
It is the masters who have, in every instance, been the
“fugitives”—running away from loyal slaves as well as loyal soldiers,
and whom we have only partially been able to see—chiefly
their heads over ramparts, or, rifle in hand, dodging behind trees,
in the extreme distance. In the absence of any “fugitive master”
law, the deserted slaves would be wholly without remedy, had not
the crime of treason given them the right to pursue, capture, and
bring back those persons of whose protection they have been thus
suddenly bereft.</p>

<p class='c019'>To the third interrogatory, it is my painful duty to reply, that I
never have received any specific authority for issues of clothing,
uniforms, arms, equipments, etc., to the troops in question. My
general instructions from Mr. Cameron, to employ them in any manner
I might find necessary, and the military exigencies of the
department and the country being my only, but, in my judgment,
sufficient justification. Neither have I had any specific authority
for supplying these persons with shovels, spades and pickaxes
when employing them as laborers, nor with boats and oars when using
them as lightermen; but these are not points included in Mr. Wickliffe’s
resolution. To me it seemed that liberty to employ men in
any particular capacity implied with it liberty also to supply them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>with the necessary tools; and acting under this faith I have clothed,
equipped and armed the only loyal regiment yet raised in South
Carolina.</p>

<p class='c019'>I must say in vindication of my conduct that had it not been for
the many other diversified and imperative claims on my time, a
much more satisfactory result might have been hoped for; and that,
in place of only one, as at present, at least five or six well-drilled,
brave, and thoroughly acclimated regiments should by this time
have been added to the loyal forces of the Union.</p>

<p class='c019'>The experiment of arming the blacks, so far as I have made it,
has been a complete and even marvellous success. They are sober,
docile, attentive, and enthusiastic, displaying great natural capacities
for acquiring the duties of a soldier. They are eager beyond
all things to take the field and be led into action; and it is the
unanimous opinion of the officers who have had charge of them, that
in the peculiarities of this climate and country, they will prove
invaluable auxiliaries, fully equal to the similar regiments so long
and successfully used by the British authorities in the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c019'>In conclusion I would say it is my hope, there appearing to be no
possibility of other reinforcements owing to the exigencies of the
campaign in the peninsular, to have organized by the end of next
fall and to be able to present to the Government from forty-eight
to fifty thousand of these hardy and devoted soldiers.</p>

<p class='c019'>Trusting that this letter may form part of your answer to Mr.
Wickliffe’s resolution.</p>

<p class='c019'>I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='c026'><span class='sc'>D. Hunter</span>,</p>
<p class='c025'><i>Major General Commanding</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The reading of this famous document in the House brought out
such a storm of laughter, from both friends and foes that further action
was impossible. The Hon. Sunset Cox speaking of the matter
some years later said: “I tell you that letter from Hunter spoiled
the prettiest speech I had ever thought of making. I had been delighted
with Wickliffe’s motion, and thought the reply to it would
furnish us with first-rate democratic thunder for the next election.
I made up my mind to sail in on Hunter’s answer no matter what
it was—the moment it came, and to be even more humorously, successful
in its delivery and reception than I was in my speech
against war-horse Gurley of Ohio. Well you see, man proposes,
but Providence orders otherwise. When the clerk announced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>receipt of the letter, and that he was about to read it, I caught the
Speaker’s eye, and was booked for the first speech against your
Negro experiment. The first sentence being formal and official
was very well; but at the second the House began to grin, and at the
third, there was not a man on the floor, except Father Wickliffe, of
Kentucky, perhaps, who was not convulsed with laughter. Even
my own risibles I found to be affected, and before the document
was concluded, I motioned to the Speaker that he might give the
floor to whom he pleased, as my desire to distinguish myself in
that particular tilt was over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The beginning of 1863, saw the opening of the doors to the Negro
in every direction. General Lorenzo Thomas went in person
to the valley of the Mississippi to supervise it there. Massachusetts
was authorized to fill its quota with Negroes. The States of Maryland,
Missouri, Delaware and Tennessee were thrown open by order
of the War Department, and all slaves enlisting therefrom declared
free. Ohio, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York joined the
band and sent the stalwart black boy in blue to the front singing,
“Give us a flag, all free, without a slave.” For two years the
fierce and determined opposition had kept them out, but now the
bars were down and they came pouring in. Some one said he cared
not who made the laws of a people if he could make their songs. A
better exemplification of this would be difficult to find than is the
song written by “Miles O’Reilly” (Col. Halpine), of the old 10th
Army Corps. I cannot resist the temptation to quote it here.
With General Hunter’s letter and this song to quote from, the episode
was closed:</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>It took three years of war to place the enlisted Negro upon the
same ground as the enlisted white man as to pay and emoluments;
<i>perhaps</i> six years of war might have given him shoulder-straps, but
the war ended without authorization of law for that step. At first
they were received, under an act of Congress that allowed each
one, without regard to rank, ten dollars per month, three dollars
thereof to be retained for clothing and equipments. I think it was
in May, ’64, when the act was passed equalizing the pay, but not
opening the doors to promotion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Under an act of the Confederate Congress, making it a crime punishable
with death for any white person to train any Negro or mulatto
to arms, or aid them in any military enterprise, and devoting
the Negro caught under arms to the tender mercies of the “present
or future laws of the State” in which caught, a large number of <i>promotions</i>
were made by the way of a rope and a tree along the first
year of the Negro’s service (I can even recall one instance as late
as April 1865, though it had been long before then generally discontinued).</p>

<p class='c012'>What the Negro did, how he did it, and where, it would take
volumes to properly record, I can however give but briefest mention
to a few of the many evidences of his fitness for the duties of
the war, and his aid to the cause of the Union.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first fighting done by organized Negro troops appears to
have been done by Company A, First South Carolina Negro Regiment,
at St. Helena Island, November 3-10, 1862, while participating
in an expedition along the coast of Georgia and Florida under
Lt.-Col. O. T. Beard, of the Forty-eighth New York Infantry,
who says in his report:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“The colored men fought with astonishing coolness and bravery.
I found them all I could desire, more than I had hoped. They behaved
gloriously, and deserve all praise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The testimony thus inaugurated runs like a cord of gold through
the web and woof of the history of the Negro as a soldier from that
date to their final charge, the last made at Clover Hill, Va., April
9, 1865.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Necessarily the first actions in which the Negro bore a part commanded
most attention. Friends and enemies were looking eagerly
to see how they would acquit themselves, and so it comes to pass
that the names of Fort Wagner, Olustee, Millikens Bend, Port
Hudson and Fort Pillow are as familiar as Bull Run, Antietam, Shiloh
and Gettysburg, and while those first experiences were mostly
severe reverses, they were by that very fact splendid exemplifiers
of the truth that the Negroes, could be relied upon to fight under
the most adverse circumstances, against any odds, and could not be
discouraged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us glance for a moment at Port Hudson, La., in May, 1863,
assaulted by General Banks with a force of which the First and Second
Regiments, Louisiana Native Guards, formed a part. When
starting upon their desperate mission, Colonel Stafford of the First
Regiment in turning over the regimental colors to the color guard,
made a brief and patriotic address, closing in the words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Color Guard: Protect, defend, die for, but do not surrender
these colors.” The gallant flag-sergeant, Plancianos, taking them
replied: “Colonel: I will bring back these colors to you in honor,
or report to God the reason why.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Six times with desperate valor they charged over ground where
success was hopeless, a deep bayou between them and the works of
the enemy at the point of attack rendered it impossible to reach
them, yet strange to say, six times they were ordered forward and
six times they went to useless death, until swept back by the blazing
breath of shot and shell before which nothing living could stand.
Here fell the gallant Captain Cailloux, black as the ace of spades;
refusing to leave the field though his arm had been shattered by a
bullet he returned to the charge until killed by a shell.</p>

<p class='c012'>A soldier limping painfully to the front was halted and asked
where he was going, he replied; “I am shot bad in de leg, and dey
want me to go to de hospital, but I guess I can give ’em a little
more yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colors came back but crimsoned with the blood of the gallant
Plancianos, who reported to God from that bloody field.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shall we glance from this to Millikens Bend, La., in January, 1863,
garrisoned by the Ninth and Eleventh Louisiana and the First Mississippi,
all Negroes, and about one hundred and sixty of the twenty-third
Iowa (white), about eleven hundred fighting men in all. Attacked
by a force of six Confederate regiments, crushed out of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>works by sheer weight of numbers, borne down toward the levee,
fighting every step of the way, hand to hand, clubbed musket, bayonets
and swords, from three a. m. to twelve, noon, when a Union
gun-boat came to the rescue and shelled the desperate foe back
to the woods, with a total loss to the defenders of 437 men, two-fifths
of their strength.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shall we turn with sadness to Fort Wagner, S. C., in July, 1863,
when the Fifty-fourth Mass. won its deathless fame, and its grand
young commander, Col. Robert Gould Shaw, passed into the temple
of immortality. After a march of all day, under a burning sun, and
all night through a tempest of wind and rain, drenched, exhausted,
hungry, they wheel into line, without a murmur for that awful
charge, that dance of death, the struggle against hopeless odds, and
the shattered remnants were hurled back as from the mouth of hell,
leaving the dead bodies of their young commander and his noble
followers to be buried in a common grave. Its total loss was about
one-third of its strength.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here it was that the gallant Flag-sergeant Carney, though grievously
wounded, bore back his flag to safety, and fell fainting and
exhausted with loss of blood, saying, “Boys, the old flag never
touched the ground!” Or another glance, at ill-starred Olustee,
where the gallant 8th U. S. C. T. lost 87 killed of its effective
fighting force, the largest loss in any one colored regiment in any
one action of the war. And so on, by Fort Pillow, which let us
pass in merciful silence, and to Honey Hill, S. C., perhaps the last
desperate fight in the far south, in which the 32nd, 35th and
102nd U. S. C. T. and the 54th and 55th Mass. Inf. won fresh and
fadeless laurels for splendid fighting against hopeless odds and insurmountable
difficulties, and then to Nashville, Tennessee, with its
recorded loss of 84 killed in the effectives of the 13th U. S. C. T.</p>

<p class='c012'>These were all brilliant actions, and they covered the actors
with and reflected upon the race a blaze of glory. But it was in
the armies of the James and of the Potomac that the true metal of
the Negro as a soldier rang out its clearest notes amid the tremendous
diapasons that rolled back and forth between the embattled
hosts. Here was war indeed, upon its grandest scale, and in all its
infinite variety. The tireless march under burning sun, chilling
frosts and driven tempests, the lonely vigil of the picket under starless
skies, the rush and roar of countless “hosts to battle driven” in
the mad charge and the victorious shout that pursued the fleeing foe;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the grim determination that held its line of defenses with set teeth,
blood-shot eye and strained muscle beating back charge after charge
of the foe; the patient labor in trench and mine, on hill and in valley,
swamp and jungle, with disease adding its horrors to the decimation
of shot and shell.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here the Negro stood in the full glare of the greatest search light,
part and parcel of the grandest armies ever mustered upon this continent,
competing side by side with the best and bravest of the Union
army against the flower of the Confederacy, the best and bravest of
Lee’s army, and losing nothing in the contrast. Never again while
time lasts will the doubt arise as in 1861, “Will the Negro fight?” As
a problem, it has been solved, as a question it has been answered, and
as a fact it is as established as the eternal hills. It was they who
rang up the curtain upon the last act of the bloody tragedy at
Petersburg, Va., June 15, 1864, and they who rang it down at
Clover Hill, Va., April 9, 1865. They were one of the strong
fingers upon the mighty hand that grasped the giant’s throat at
Petersburg and never flexed until the breath went out at Appomattox.
In this period it would take page on page to recount their
deeds of valor and their glorious victories.</p>

<p class='c012'>See them on the 15th of June, 1864, carrying the outpost at Baylor’s
field in early morning, and all that long, hot, summer day
advancing, a few yards at a time, then lying down to escape the
fire from the works, but still gradually creeping nearer and nearer,
until, just as the sun went down, they swept like a tornado over the
works and started upon a race for the city, close at the heels of the
flying foe, until mistakenly ordered back. Of this day’s experience
Gen. Badeau writes: “No worse strain on the nerves of troops is
possible, for it is harder to remain quiet under cannon fire, even
though comparatively harmless, than to advance against a storm of
musketry.” General W. F. “Baldy” Smith, speaking of their conduct,
says: “No nobler effort has been put forth to-day, and no
greater success achieved than that of the colored troops.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In his order of the day he says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the colored troops comprising the Division of General Hinks,
the general commanding would call the attention of his command.
With the veterans of the Eighteenth corps, they have stormed the
works of the enemy and carried them, taking guns and prisoners,
and in the whole affair they have displayed all the qualities of good
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Or, again, at the terrible mine explosion of July 30, 1864, on the
Petersburg line, and at the fearful slaughter of September 29, 1864,
at New Market Heights and Fort Harrison. On this last date in the
Fourth U. S. Col. Troops, out of a color guard of twelve men, but one
came off the field on his own feet. The gallant Flag-sergeant Hilton,
the last to fall, cried out as he went down, “Boys, save the colors;”
and they were saved.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the magnificent fighting of this last date, under date of Oct.
11, 1864, Maj.-General B. F. Butler issued an order, a portion of
which I quote, as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of the colored soldiers of the third divisions of the 18th and
10th Corps and the officers who led them, the general commanding
desires to make special mention. In the charge on the enemy’s
works by the colored division of the 18th Corps at New Market,
better men were never better led, better officers never led better
men. A few more such gallant charges and to command colored
troops will be the post of honor in the American armies. The colored
soldiers, by coolness, steadiness, determined courage and dash,
have silenced every cavil of the doubters of their soldierly capacity,
and drawn tokens of admiration from their enemies, have brought
their late masters even to the consideration of the question whether
they will not employ as soldiers the hitherto despised race.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Some ten or more years later, in Congress, in the midst of a
speech advocating the giving of civil rights to the Negro, Gen.
Butler said, referring to this incident:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, in a space not wider than the clerk’s desk, and three
hundred yards long, lay the dead bodies of 543 of my colored comrades,
slain in the defense of their country, who had laid down their
lives to uphold its flag and its honor, as a willing sacrifice. And as
I rode along, guiding my horse this way and that, lest he should
profane with his hoofs what seemed to me the sacred dead, and as I
looked at their bronzed faces upturned in the shining sun, as if in
mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had
given their lives, and whose flag had been to them a flag of stripes,
in which no star of glory had ever shone for them—feeling I had
wronged them in the past, and believing what was the future duty
of my country to them—I swore to myself a solemn oath: ‘May
my right hand forget its cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof
of my mouth, if ever I fail to defend the rights of the men who have
given their blood for me and my country this day and for their race
forever.’ And, God helping me, I will keep that oath.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Or another instance: when under Butler first and Terry later,
driven by storms and tempestous seas to powerful Fort Fisher,
cooperating with our gallant Navy in its capture, and thence starting
on the long march that led through Wilmington, and on to
Goldsboro, N. C., where Johnson’s army, the last large force of the
Confederacy in the field, was caught between the forces under
Terry and the forces under Howard; and the war as such was ended
with his surrender, April 26, 1865.</p>

<p class='c012'>A little of statistics, and I will close.</p>

<p class='c012'>The total number of colored soldiers in this last war was 178,975,
and the number of deaths 36,847.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of enlistments the United States made 96,337, and the several
States 79,638.</p>

<p class='c012'>All of which points are treated with great detail, and summed up
as follows:</p>
<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“For the purposes of the soldier he has all the physical characteristics
required, his temperament adapts him to camp life, and his
morale conduces to discipline. He is also brave and steady in
action. In all subsequent wars the country will rely largely upon
its Negro population as a part of its military power.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Under the act of Congress passed July 12, 1862, the President
of the United States was authorized to have prepared, with suitable
emblematic devices, Medals of Honor to be presented in the name of
the Congress to such soldiers as should most distinguish themselves
by their gallantry in action and other soldierly qualities. So chary
has the Government been in their issue that the award has not
reached two thousand among the three millions of volunteers and
regulars in the Army and Navy. So that these medals are more rare
than the “Victoria Cross” of England, the “Iron Cross” of Germany,
or the “Cross of the Legion of Honor” of France.</p>

<p class='c012'>I copy the list of those issued to Negro soldiers as they stand
upon the records, that is, in the numerical order of the regiments

<p class='c021'>It is but a little thing to ask, they could ask no less: <i>be just</i>; but,
oh, the shame of it for those who need be asked!</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no need for panegyric, for sounding phrases or rounded
periods. The simple story is eloquent with all that is necessary to
make the heart swell with pride. In the hour allotted me to fill, it
is possible only to indicate in skeleton the worth of the Negro as a
soldier. If this brief sketch should awaken even a few to interest
in his achievements, and one be found willing and fitted to write the
history that is their due, that writer shall achieve immortality.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
